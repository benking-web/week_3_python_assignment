### Here are the itemized steps for creating a repository, cloning it to your local system, and submitting an assignment:

### 1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   - **Sign in to GitHub**: Open [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account.
   - **Create a new repository**:
     - Click on the **+** icon in the top right corner and select **New repository**.
     - Enter a **Repository name** (e.g., `assignment-repo`).
     - Optionally, add a **description** of the repository.
     - Choose **Public** or **Private** based on your preferences.
     - Choose whether to initialize the repository with a README (optional).
     - Click **Create repository**.

### 2. **Clone the Repository to Your Local System**
   - **Copy the repository URL**:
     - On your newly created repository page, click the **Code** button.
     - Copy the URL provided (either HTTPS or SSH).
   - **Clone using Git**:
     - Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
     - Run the following command to clone the repository (replace `<repo-url>` with the copied URL):
       ```bash
       git clone <repo-url>
       ```
     - Example:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/assignment-repo.git
       ```

### 3. **Work on Your Assignment**
   - **Navigate into the cloned repository folder**:
     ```bash
     cd assignment-repo
     ```
   - **Add your assignment files**:
     - Create or copy the files related to your assignment (e.g., code, documents) into the repository folder.
   - **Stage the changes**:
     - After adding your files, use the following command to stage them for commit:
       ```bash
       git add .
       ```
     - This stages all the files in the current directory.

   - **Commit your changes**:
     - Commit the changes with a meaningful message:
       ```bash
       git commit -m "Added assignment files"
       ```

### 4. **Push Changes to GitHub**
   - **Push the committed changes** to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```
     - If you're using a branch other than `main`, replace `main` with your branch name.

### 5. **Submit the Assignment**
   - **Verify submission**:
     - Go back to the GitHub repository in your web browser to make sure your files have been uploaded.
   - **Submit the link**:
     - Copy the URL of your repository (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/assignment-repo`).
     - Submit this URL as per the submission instructions (e.g., in a course portal, email, etc.).

That's it! You've successfully created a repository, cloned it to your local machine, worked on your assignment, and submitted it.
