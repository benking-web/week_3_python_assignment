#Question 

#Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
#Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.



#Solution 

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    # Check if the discount is 20% or higher
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        # Calculate the discounted price
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        # No discount applied, return original price
        return price

# Prompt the user for input
price = float(input("Enter the original price of the item: "))
discount_percent = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

# Call the function to calculate the final price
final_price = calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)

# Display the final price or the original price if no discount is applied
print(f"The final price is: ${final_price:.2f}")
